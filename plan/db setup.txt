Here are the instructions to set up your PostgreSQL database using Neon.

Step 1: Create a Neon Project
Go to Neon.tech and Sign Up or Log In.

Click the "New Project" button.

Name your project (e.g., event-planner).

Region: Select the region closest to you (e.g., Singapore ap-southeast-1 or US East).

Postgres Version: You can leave this as the default (usually 15 or 16).

Click Create Project.

Step 2: Get Your Connection String
Once the project is created, you will be taken to the Dashboard.

Look for the "Connection Details" section.

Ensure you are on the "Prisma" tab (if available) or just standard "postgres".

Pooled Connection:

Uncheck "Pooled connection" for now (Direct connections are simpler for initial setup with Prisma).

Note: If you deploy to Vercel later, you might want to use the pooled string, but for local dev, direct is fine.

Copy the entire connection string. It will look like this: postgres://alex:AbC123_@ep-cool-frog-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require

Step 3: Add to Your Project
Open your project in VS Code.
Open the file apps/web/.env.

Find the DATABASE_URL line and paste your connection string inside the quotes:

Bash

# apps/web/.env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://alex:AbC123_@ep-cool-frog-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require"
Step 4: Push Your Schema
Now you need to create the tables in your new Neon database based on your Prisma code.

Open your terminal in the root folder of your project.

Run the generation command (this updates your node_modules with the new schema):

Bash
pnpm db:generate
Run the push command (this actually creates the tables in Neon):

Bash
pnpm db:push


Step 5: Verify
Run the Prisma Studio command:

Bash

pnpm db:studio
It will open a webpage at http://localhost:5555.

If you see tabs for User, Event, Guest, etc., your database is set up and connected!
