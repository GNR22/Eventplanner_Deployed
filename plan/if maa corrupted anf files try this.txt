It looks like your project dependencies are corrupted or missing. This is causing the MODULE_NOT_FOUND errors (e.g., missing globby, styled-jsx, cross-spawn).

⚠️ Important Warning: OneDrive Issue I see your project is located in ~/OneDrive/Desktop/planner. OneDrive is notorious for breaking Node.js projects. OneDrive tries to sync the thousands of files inside node_modules to the cloud, often locking them or removing them from your local disk to save space (Files On-Demand). This is likely why your computer can't find specific files like cross-spawn.

🛠️ The Fix
We need to completely clean your installation and reinstall everything fresh. Please run these commands in your terminal one by one:

1. Clean the project
Remove the existing node_modules and lock file to ensure a clean slate.

Bash

rm -rf node_modules
rm -rf pnpm-lock.yaml
rm -rf .next
(If rm -rf doesn't work in your specific terminal, you can manually delete the node_modules folder and pnpm-lock.yaml file from your file explorer).

2. Reinstall Dependencies
This will download all the missing packages correctly.

Bash

pnpm install
3. Generate Database Client
Since this is a fresh install, we need to regenerate the Prisma client so the app knows how to talk to the database.

Bash

pnpm db:generate
4. Push Database Schema (Optional but recommended)
Now try the command that failed earlier to ensure your database is in sync.

Bash

pnpm db:push
5. Start the Server
Now try running the development server again.

Bash

pnpm dev
💡 Recommendation for the Future
If you continue to have issues, move your project folder OUT of OneDrive. Move it to a local folder like C:\Projects\planner or C:\Users\Ryan Ranada\planner (outside of the OneDrive folder). This prevents the cloud sync from corrupting your dependency files.
